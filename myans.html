        <h2 class="fs-2 text-danger">1. Difference between map, filter, foreach, find.</h2>
        <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Ans: </span>
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.map() </span>executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.filter()</span> checks every element in an array to see if it find the same criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the condition.
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.forEach(),</span> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.find() </span>is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail, this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.</p>

        <h2 class="fs-2 text-success">1. Difference between localStorage, sessionStorage & Cookie.</h2>
        <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Ans: </span><br>
          <span class="fw-semibold">localStorage:</span> can store data on the clientâ€™s computer. It allows the saving of key/value both in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed in JavaScript and HTML5. Although, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to remove all localStorage data. <br>
          <span class="fw-semibold">sessionStorage:</span>stores data only for a session, that's mean the data is stored until the browser is closed. sessionStorage data is never transferred to the server. It can only be read on client-side and storage limit is about 5-10MB. When we opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window <br>
          <span class="fw-semibold">Cookie:</span>stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Cookie expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .Cookies are primarily for server-side reading, localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.

      <h2 class="fs-2 text-primary-emphasis">3. What is event loop and how it works in JavaScript?</h2>
      <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-semibold text-decoration-underline">Ans:</span> The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. And the Event Loop works as to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Although this iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

      <h2 class="fs-2 text-warning-emphasis">4. What is the work of quizTimer function?</h2>
      <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-semibold text-decoration-underline">Ans:</span> Here, quizTimer a callback function. Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function when it completes its task. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous.At first quizTimer function do quizTimer(true) value and this value pass the empty quizTimer() inside setInterval()</p>

      <h2 class="fs-2 text-danger-emphasis">5. What is the work of displayQuiz function?</h2>
      <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-semibold text-decoration-underline">Ans:</span> Here, displayQuiz a callback function. Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function when it completes its task. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous. Here, at first displayQuiz function check the async data is it ok or not. If that is not data then innerHTML set in quizContainer and fulfill their task.
