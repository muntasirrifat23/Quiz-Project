        <h2 class="fs-2 text-danger">1. Difference between map, filter, foreach, find.</h2>
        <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Ans: </span>
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.map() </span>executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.filter()</span> checks every element in an array to see if it find the same criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the condition.
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.forEach(),</span> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
        <br><span class="fw-semibold">.find() </span>is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail, this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.</p>

        <h2 class="fs-2 text-success">1. Difference between localStorage, sessionStorage & Cookie.</h2>
        <p class="fs-5"><span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Ans: </span><br>
          <span class="fw-semibold">localStorage:</span> can store data on the clientâ€™s computer. It allows the saving of key/value both in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed in JavaScript and HTML5. Although, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to remove all localStorage data. <br>
          <span class="fw-semibold">sessionStorage:</span>stores data only for a session, that's mean the data is stored until the browser is closed. sessionStorage data is never transferred to the server. It can only be read on client-side and storage limit is about 5-10MB. When we opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window <br>
          <span class="fw-semibold">Cookie:</span>stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent XHR requests. Cookie expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side .Cookies are primarily for server-side reading, localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.
